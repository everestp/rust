 /*
    One of the simplest but most powerful lessons Iâ€™ve picked up in Rust ðŸ¦€
ðŸ‘‰ Passing by mutable reference = you change the same data, nothing is returned.
 ðŸ‘‰ Returning a value = you get a brand new copy to work with.
Itâ€™s such a small detail, but it forces you to be crystal clear:
 Am I mutating, or am I creating something new?
This mindset actually applies to life too â€” are you trying to change what exists, or create something new? ðŸ’¡
